# Multi Camera Calibration

1. 'modules/camera_calibration/app/camera_calibration.cpp' is for calculating extrinsic parameter of each individual cameras.
2. 'modules/camera_calibration/app/HandEyeCalibration.cpp' is the implmentation of multi-camera hand-eye calibration algorithm.

## Usage
1. Pre-calibrate the intrinsic parameters of each camera with arbitary open-sourced methods, e.g. rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py ...
2. Use modified config file (e.g parameter/AGV_calib/extrinsic_17023550.xml), change the input path, pattern size, number of corners, number of images to be extrinsically calibrated and intrinsics. Select the options of using pre-computed camera model or not, and moving cameras or calibration target.
3. Run: `./camera_calibration settingFilePath SavePath`, rename the `TrajectoryByCV.txt` as you wish.
4. Formulate the captured trajectory from tracking system as `timestamp tx ty tz qx qy qz qw` into file `TrajectoryByGT.txt`:
   ```
    double timestamp; // second
    double tx ty tz; // give the position
    double qx qy qz qw; // give the orientation in quaternion format
   ```
5. Modify the config file (e.g parameter/multi_extrinsic_handeye.yaml). 
   ```
    int NumOfMeasures; // How many measurements will be used for calibration
    bool UseMultiCam; // Use our proposed method or existing single hand-eye/robot-world algorithms
    bool HandeyeSolver; // Type of Solver: Shah[0] Li[1]
   ```
6. Run: `./handeye_camera_calibration settingFilePath GTFilePath_1 TrajectoryFile_1 GTFilePath_2 TrajectoryFile_2 ...`

## Datasets
For convenience we provide a zip file for testing:
   ```
    'AGV_Calib_for_test/CAM_ID/resize' are for computing the camera trajectories individually. please refer to Usage 2. 
    'AGV_Calib_for_test/CAM_ID/gt_CAM_ID' are fomulated captured trajectory from tracking system. please refer to Usage 4.
    'AGV_Calib_for_test/handeye' contains the prepared GTFiles and TrajectoryFiles, please refer to Usage 5 and 6.
   ```
